Stronghold requires USDC in your wallet to pay for scans. There are two ways to fund your account.

## Option 1: Dashboard (Recommended)

Visit the [dashboard](https://getstronghold.xyz/dashboard) to fund your wallet through a web interface. The dashboard supports:

- **Stripe** — pay with a credit or debit card (fiat-to-USDC on-ramp)

The Stripe integration converts your payment into USDC and delivers it to your wallet on-chain. This is **not** a separate payment method — all API payments still use x402. Stripe only handles the initial funding step.

> **Note:** Stripe requires a linked wallet address (Base or Solana) before you can initiate a purchase. Link your wallet via the dashboard or with `stronghold wallet link` before depositing.

## Option 2: Direct USDC Transfer

Send USDC directly to your wallet address on **Base** (EVM) or **Solana**. Direct transfers are detected and credited automatically after blockchain confirmation.

To view your deposit addresses, run `stronghold account deposit`. This displays your Base (EVM) and Solana wallet addresses (if configured) along with instructions:

```bash
stronghold account deposit
```

## Checking Your Balance

Use the CLI to check your balance across all configured wallets:

```bash
stronghold account balance
```

Output shows per-chain balances:

```
Base (EVM) Wallet:
  0x1234...5678
  Balance: 4.500000 USDC

Solana Wallet:
  ABC123...XYZ
  Balance: 2.000000 USDC
```

## Low Balance Warning

The web dashboard displays a warning when your wallet balance drops below **1 USDC**. At $0.001 per scan, 1 USDC covers approximately 1,000 requests — so this warning gives you time to top up before running out.
